<H1> The Best Movies According to Hannah</H1>

<h2>My top 4 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr> 

    <h3>1. Howl's Moving Castle </h3>
<p>
         <h4> This is my far my favourite animate movie of all time. I love the sweeping views, brilliant animation and the plot loops are fantastic.</h4>
</p>

<h3>2. Bram Stoker's Dracula  </h3>
<p>
        <h4> While I am absolutely terrified of anything even remotely horror based, I loved this film so much. <br>
             The visiting of Romanian legends, and the depiction of love between Winona Ryder and Gary Oldman was something to behold. </h4>
</p>

<h3>3. Gone with the Wind </h3>
<p>
        <h4>  While this film has many critiques, I believe that this film is a very important piece of history. <br>
            It is a painful yet neccessary reminder of humanities greed and arrogance over the wellbeing and lives of the slaves which should never be repeated.</h4>
</p>

<h3>4. Titanic </h3>
<p>
        <h4> As someone with a father who has a deep love for all history, I was sucked into this historic tragedy very early on in my life. <br>
        As an adult, I still have a hard time watching the large amounts of loss all in just a few hours   </h4>
